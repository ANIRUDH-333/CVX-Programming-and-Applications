Optimization is a key analysis technique used to make quantitative decisions about real-world problems. In addition, with the development of new technologies, there are more and more complex and multi-dimensional optimization models. Convex optimization for several reasons seems to have several tools to solve problems. This project shall be a pedagogical first step towards convex optimization and solving real world problems using convex optimization.
