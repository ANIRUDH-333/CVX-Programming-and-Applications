# CVX-Programming-and-Applications
Optimization is a key analysis technique used to make quantitative decisions about real-world problems. In addition, with the development of new technologies, there are more and more complex and multi-dimensional optimization models. Convex optimization for several reasons seems to have several tools to solve problems. This project shall be a pedagogical first step towards convex optimization and solving real world problems using convex optimization.

# About each problem
Understand about each of the problem in depth by going through the [report](Team01_report.pdf) and solve the problem with help of code for each problem in the [Problems Folder](Problems)
